[![Ask DeepWiki](https://devin.ai/assets/askdeepwiki.png)](https://deepwiki.com/carlosz98/MyPortFolio)

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, available at [charlyzabala.com](http://charlyzabala.com). It showcases my projects, certifications, and skills as a programmer and software developer. The website is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and features a responsive design, a dark/light mode toggle, and an interactive animated character.

## üëã About Me

I am an undergraduate student at LaGuardia Community College, majoring in Programming and Software Development. My expertise lies in languages like C++, C#, and Java, with a strong foundation in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures, and Algorithms. I also have experience in web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and game development using Unreal Engine 5 and Unity. In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects, exploring new technologies, and collecting retro hardware.
